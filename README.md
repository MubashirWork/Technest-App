# Technest

A practice e-commerce app UI built in Flutter to demonstrate my skills in creating
clean, interactive, and user-friendly mobile interfaces. This app is designed for selling computers
and accessories such as RAM, mice, keyboards, and other peripherals. It features multiple screens and
components to simulate a complete shopping experience, including viewing product details, managing a
cart, placing orders, and managing user profiles.
